INSTALLATION OF THE HIAWATHA WEBSERVER
=======================================
Copy the directory 'Hiawatha' to a suitable location on your harddisk. The full
path to this directory will be refered to as <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR> in the rest
of this documentation. Run the batch file <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>\Hiawatha.bat
to start the Hiawatha webserver.


INSTALLATION OF PHP
====================
To use PHP, download the PHP zip package from http://php.net/downloads.php and
unzip it to C:\Program Files\PHP7\.

Optionally, run <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>\PHP7-FastCGI.bat to start PHP as a
FastCGI daemon. If you installed PHP7 in another directory, edit the batch file
to change the path to the PHP7 binary.


MANUAL PAGES
=============
The Hiawatha manual pages can be found in <HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>/documentation.


RUNNING HIAWATHA AS A WINDOWS SERVICE
======================================
If you want to run Hiawatha as a Windows service, run the batch file
<HIAWATHA_INSTALL_DIR>/Service.bat as Administrator. Hiawatha can now be
started and stopped via Computer Management: in the Windows Explorer,
right-click on 'My Computer', select 'Manage', select 'Services and
Applications', select 'Services' and select 'Hiawatha webserver'.

Please note that Hiawatha will run as the user SYSTEM. All logfiles created by
Hiawatha will therefore be owned by this user. To change this, open the
Hiawatha service in the Computer Management window, go to the tab 'Log On' and
change the account.


TROUBLESHOOTING
================
If you experience some trouble with Hiawatha under Windows, try installing
Cygwin with the packages libxml2 and libxslt. If that doesn't solve your
problem, use the forum at https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/.
