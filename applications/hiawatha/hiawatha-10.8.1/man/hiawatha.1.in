.SH DESCRIPTION
Hiawatha is a secure webserver for Unix. It has been written with 'being secure' and 'easy to use' as its main goals. Hiawatha has lots of features that no other webserver has. Although most of them started as an experiment, many of them turned out to be quite effective.
.br

Hiawatha has been tested and runs perfectly on Linux, BSD, MacOS X and Cygwin.

.\" ==========[ Configuration files ]==========================================
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
Hiawatha has the following configuration files:
.TP
.B cgi-wrapper.conf
See cgi-wrapper(1) for more information.
.TP
.B hiawatha.conf
See chapters SERVER CONFIGURATION, BINDING CONFIGURATION, VIRTUAL HOST CONFIGURATION, DIRECTORY CONFIGURATION, FASTCGI CONFIGURATION, URL TOOLKIT and XSLT for more information.
.TP
.B mimetype.conf
See chapter MIMETYPES for more information.
.TP
.B .hiawatha
See chapter USER SETTINGS PER DIRECTORY for more information.

.\" ==========[ Records ]=====================================================
.SH RECORDS
The binding, directory, FastCGI, virtual host and URL toolkit configuration must be placed inside a record. A record is defined as follows:
.br

Record {
.br
	...
.br
}

where the word "Record" must be replaced with "Binding", "Directory", "FastCGIserver", "VirtualHost" or "UrlToolkit".

.\" ==========[ Server configuration ]=========================================
.SH SERVER CONFIGURATION
The global configuration of the Hiawatha webserver.
.TP
.B set variable = value
With 'set', you can declare a variable. Make sure the name of the variable doesn't conflict with any of the configuration options. The variables are case-sensitive and cannot be redeclared. The variable CONFIG_DIR will be set by Hiawatha to the directory where hiawatha.conf is located.
.br
Example: set local_net = 192.168.1.0/24
         AccessList = allow local_net, deny 0.0.0.0/0 (see AccessList for more information about this option)
.TP
.B AnonymizeIP = yes|no
Anonymize IP addresses before writing them to the access and error logfiles or sending them to the Hiawatha Monitor.
.br
Default = no     Example: AnonymizeIP = yes
.TP
.B BanlistMask = (allow|deny) <ip-address>[/netmask][, (allow|deny) <ip-address>[/netmask], ...]
Prevent IPs from getting banned in case of bad behaviour. By default, all IPs can be banned. IPs that are 'denied' in the banlist will not be banned.
.br
Example: BanlistMask = deny 127.0.0.1, deny 192.168.0.1
.TP

When the total amount of connections reaches <threshold>, Hiawatha sends a response to the first request in a connection which will make the client resend the request, but now with a cookie. The cookie can be set via an HTTP Set-Cookie header or a Javascript. Further requests are only accepted when the client sends this cookie. Otherwise, the client is banned for <ban-time> seconds. This feature can be used to reduce the effects of a DDoS attack. The <secret> can be a random string of up to 20 characters (the rest is ignored) and is used to generate the cookie. When not set, Hiawatha will generate a random secret.

.\" ==========[ Host configuration ]===========================================
.SH VIRTUAL HOST CONFIGURATION
The (virtual) hosts the webserver will be serving. The first host must NOT be placed inside a record. This is the default host and therefor not virtual. It is wise to have the IP-address of the webserver as the Hostname of the default host and give it a blank page. Automated vulnerable-website scanners will not find your possible vulnerable website if you do so.
.TP
.B AccessList = (allow|deny|pwd) <ip-address>[/netmask][, (allow|deny|pwd) <ip-address>[/netmask], ...]
Define which IPs have access to the website. If an IP does not match an entry in the list, access is granted. 'all' is an alias for 0.0.0.0/0. The IP address of the machine that connects and the IP address specified in the X-Forwarded-For header field (deny only) will be used to find a match. 'allow' gives access, 'deny' denies access and 'pwd' gives access if a valid password has been given (see PasswordFile for more information).
.br
Hiawatha will ignore this setting for files in /.well-known/acme-challenge/, which are used for authentication in the Let's Encrypt certificate request process.

.B AllowDotFiles = <yes|no>
Allow files that start with a dot (hidden files for Unix) to be downloaded by a client. Requests for .hiawatha files are always blocked. A requests URI that start with /.well-known/ is always accepted, as defined in RFC 5785.
.br
Default = no     Example: AllowDotFiles = yes
.TP
.B AlterGroup = <groupname>[, <groupname>, ...]
The <groupname> is the name of the group a user must be a member of to use the PUT and DELETE HTTP method (see PasswordFile and AlterList for more information).

.TP
.B AlterList = (allow|deny|pwd) <ip-address>[/netmask][, (allow|deny|pwd) <ip-address>[/netmask], ...]
Define which IPs are allowed to use the PUT and DELETE HTTP request method. If an IP does not match an entry in the list, usage is denied. 'all' is an alias for 0.0.0.0/0. The IP address of the machine that connects and the IP address specified in the X-Forwarded-For header field (deny only) will be used to find a match. Look out for the uploading of CGI scripts! Use "ExecuteCGI = no" in a Directory record to disable CGI execution (see EnableAlter, AlterGroup and AlterMode for more information).
.br
Example: AlterList = deny 10.0.0.13, allow 10.0.0.0/24, deny all
.TP

.TP
.B EnforceFirstHostname = yes|no
If the hostname used in the URL is not the same as the first one in the list of the Hostname setting, then Hiawatha will send a 301 redirect with that hostname. This option is ignored if the first hostname starts with a wildcard.
.br
Default = no     Example EnforceFirstHostname = yes
.TP
.B ErrorHandler = <error code>:<filename>[?key=value&...]

The generated errorcode can be found via the environment variable HTTP_GENERATED_ERROR. To override the returned HTTP code in a CGI script, use the HTTP Header "Status", for example "Status: 404".
.br
Example: ErrorHandler = 404:/error.php?code=404
.TP
.B ErrorLogfile = <filename with full path>

In case of an error, use the specified XSLT file to generate the error message. Upon any error, Hiawatha will fall back to the hardcoded error message. An example of the generated XML that will be used can be found in extra/error.xml inside the source package.
.br
Example: ErrorXSLTfile = /etc/hiawatha/error.xslt
.br

(requires that Hiawatha was not compiled with -DENABLE_XSLT=off)
.TP
.B ExecuteCGI = yes|no
Allow execution of CGI programs.
.br
Default = no     Example: ExecuteCGI = yes
.TP
.B FileHashes = <file containing file hashes>
Points Hiawatha to a file containing SHA256 hashes for every file in the webroot directory. Before serving a file, Hiawatha checks the file hash of that file. If it doesn't match, access is denied. This protects against file changes or uploading of malware. FastCGI scripts are also checked if the FastCGI server can be reached via a UNIX socket. The file hashes file can be created via the -s option of the wigwam(1) tool.
.br
Example: FileHashes = /etc/hiawatha/hashes/my_website.txt
.TP
.B FollowSymlinks = yes|no
Allow Hiawatha to follow symlinks to files and directories. Symlinks that stay inside the webroot or are owned by root are always followed. Note that this does not apply to CGI's which are executed via FastCGI, because Hiawatha is not able to look for symlinks on remote FastCGI servers.
.br
Default = no     Example: FollowSymlinks = yes
.TP
.B Hostname = <hostname>, [<hostname>, ...]
Name(s) of the host that Hiawatha will be serving. May start with a wildcard, except the first hostname (a valid name is required in case of a 301 error). Hostname is a required field.
.br
Example: Hostname = www.my-domain.com, *.my-domain.com, www.some-alias.com
.TP
.B HTTPAuthToCGI = yes|no
Place the HTTP Authorization header in the CGI's HTTP_AUTHORIZATION environment variable.
.br
Default = no     Example: HTTPAuthToCGI = yes
.TP
.B LoginMessage = <text>
Message that will be displayed in the login window in case of HTTP authentication (see PasswordFile for more information). When using Digest HTTP authentication, the LoginMessage should not contain a ':' sign.
.br
Default = Private page     Example: LoginMessage = My personal files
.TP
.B NoExtensionAs = <extension>
If the requested file has no extension, treat it as if the extension was equal to <extension>.
.br
Example: NoExtensionAs = cgi
.TP
.B PasswordFile = ((Basic|Digest):<passwordfile>)|none[, <groupfile>]
When this option is set, HTTP authentication is enabled. Use the full path to the password file when that password file should also be used for sub-directories. Entries for the password file can be created via the wigwam(1) tool. The realm for Digest HTTP authentication must be equal to the text set via LoginMessage.
.br
The <groupfile> contains the groupnames followed by the names of the users that are a member of that group. The format of the lines in the groupfile is:
.br
	<groupname>:<username>[ <username> ...]
.br
Hiawatha will ignore this setting for files in /.well-known/acme-challenge/, which are used for authentication in the Let's Encrypt certificate request process.
.br
Example: PasswordFile = basic:/var/www/.passwords,/var/www/.groups
.TP
.B PreventCSRF = no|detect|prevent|block
Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. The 'detect' option only detects and logs a CSRF attack, 'prevent' discards the POST data and cookies and 'block' returns a 443 error. This setting can cause problems for users who use tools to hide/remove the Referer HTTP header string while browsing.

Don't use this as a generic security feature. Only use it to prevent a specific vulnerablility in an application that can't be taken offline while you wait for a patch.
.br
Default = no     Example: PreventCSRF = block
.TP
.B PreventSQLi = no|detect|prevent|block
Prevent SQL-injection attacks. The 'detect' option only detects and logs an SQL injection attack, 'prevent' returns a 404 error and 'block' returns a 441 error. It is important to understand that the detection of SQL injections is done by best effort. There is no 100% guarantee that all SQL injections are blocked. Note that using this feature can have a negative effect on the performance of your webserver and can make the exploit logfile grow very large. See also BanOnSQLi and RequestLimitMask.

Don't use this as a generic security feature. Only use it to prevent a specific vulnerablility in an application that can't be taken offline while you wait for a patch.
.br
Default = no     Example: PreventSQLi = detect
.TP
.B PreventXSS = no|detect|prevent|block
Prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks. The 'detect' option only detects and logs a XSS attack, 'prevent' disables the <script> tag in the input and 'block' returns a 442 error.

Don't use this as a generic security feature. Only use it to prevent a specific vulnerablility in an application that can't be taken offline while you wait for a patch.
.br
Default = no     Example: PreventXSS = prevent
.TP
.B PublicKeyPins = <public key file>[, max_age=<value>[d]]
Hiawatha will load public keys from the <public key file>, which will be used to calculate the pin-sha256 values for the Public-Key-Pins HTTP header (HPKP). The <public key file> can contain certificates, certificate signing requests and public keys, all in PEM format. The optional max_age value is in seconds or in days when it ends with a 'd'. The default value for max_age is '30d'.
.br
Example: PublicKeyPins = /etc/hiawatha/letsencrypt.pem, 60d
.br

(requires that Hiawatha was not compiled with -DENABLE_TLS=off)
.TP
.B RequiredBinding = <binding_id>[, <binding_id>, ...]

.br
Example: RequiredBinding = LAN
.TP
.B RandomHeader = <length>
Adds an X-Random HTTP header to the response for HTTPS connections. The header contains a random string. The length of that string is a random value between 1 and <length>. This header helps to prevent attackers from guessing what file was requested based on the response length. <length> must be between 10 and 1000.
.br
Example: RandomHeader = 250
.TP
.B RequiredCA = ...
Use this option inside a virtualhost block if you want to make use of the SNI capabilities of Hiawatha. See the RequiredCA option in the BINDING CONFIGURATION chapter for more information.
.TP
.B RequiredGroup = <groupname>[, <groupname>, ...]
The <groupname> is the name of the group a user must be a member of to have access (see PasswordFile for more information).
.br
Example: RequiredGroup = webadmins,staff
.TP
.B RequireTLS = yes|no[, <HSTS time>[d]][; includeSubDomains][; preload]
Specify that a domain must be visited with a TLS connection. If it is visited via HTTP, Hiawatha will send a redirect (301) with an HTTPS URL. The <HSTS time> is the max-age value of the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP header in seconds or in days when it ends with a 'd'.
.br
Hiawatha will ignore this setting for files in /.well-known/acme-challenge/, which are used for authentication in the Let's Encrypt certificate request process.
.br
Default = no     Example: RequireTLS = yes, 2678400
.br

(requires that Hiawatha was not compiled with -DENABLE_TLS=off)
.TP
.B ReverseProxy = [!]<pattern> [<skip directories>] http[s]://<hostname>[:<port>][/<path>]|<unix-socket> [<timeout>] [keep-alive]
Forward the request with URLs that match the POSIX regular expression <pattern> to another webserver, where <path> is placed before the original URL. When <hostname> is an IP address, the value of the Host HTTP header is unchanged. Otherwise, it is replaced with the value of <hostname>. The optional <skip directories> is a number that indicates how many directories in the original URL should be skipped when sending it to the final webserver. The connection is closed after <timeout> seconds, which is set to 5 seconds by default. By default, Hiawatha doesn't use keep-alive connections to the final webserver. You can enable this by adding 'keep-alive' to the configuration line. When specifying multiple reverse proxies for one (virtual) host, Hiawatha prefers reverse proxies with a scheme (HTTP/HTTPS) matching the one of the client connection. See also CAcertificates.
.br
Example: ReverseProxy = ^/icons/ 1 http://resources.lan/images

(requires that Hiawatha was not compiled with -DENABLE_RPROXY=off)
.TP
.B RunOnAlter = <path to program>

Example: ScriptAlias = /script.cgi:/usr/lib/script.cgi
.TP
.B ShowIndex = yes|no|<XSLT file with full path>|xml
Return a directory listing in HTML format for a directory request when the startfile does not exist. If you want to change the index layout completely, specify the path of a XSLT file. If the XSLT file is not found or 'xml' is used, Hiawatha will output the XML of the directory index. An example of the XML output can be found in extra/index.xml inside the source package.
.br
Default = no     Example: ShowIndex = /etc/hiawatha/index.xslt
.br

(requires that Hiawatha was not compiled with -DENABLE_XSLT=off)

.\" ==========[ URL toolkit configuration ]====================================
.SH URL TOOLKIT
How to use the URL toolkit is explained in this chapter. To use URL toolkits, Hiawatha should not have been compiled with -DENABLE_TOOLKIT=off. The main toolkit commands are:
.TP
.B Do <action>
Perform an action, where <action> can be one of the following:
.br
Ban, Call, DenyAccess, Exit, Goto, OmitRequestLog, Return, Skip or Use.
.br
Example: Do Call other_rule_set
.TP
.B Header <key> [!]<pattern> <action>
.br
Perform an action when the HTTP header <key> matches the POSIX regular expresion <pattern>, where <action> can be one of the following:
.br
Ban, Call, DenyAccess, Exit, Goto, OmitRequestLog, Return, Skip or Use.
.br
A negative pattern (leading exclamation mark) can't be used with the redirect action. The <key> can be * to test every HTTP header. Note that the wildcard means 'any header', not 'every header'.
.TP
.B Match [!]<pattern> <action>
.br
Perform an action when the URL matches the POSIX regular expression <pattern>, where <action> can be one of the following:
.br
Ban, Call, DenyAccess, Exit, Goto, Redirect, Return, Rewrite, Skip or UseFastCGI.
.br
Use MatchCI to perform case insensitive URL matching. A negative pattern (leading exclamation mark) can't be used with the redirect and rewrite action.
.TP

.br
"Match a Rewrite b 3" will change "/aaaaa.html" into "/bbbaa.html". Default value of <max_loop> is 1, maximum is 20.
.br
Rewrite will terminate toolkit processing, unless Continue or Return has been given.
.TP
.B Skip <number>
.br
Skip the next following <number> lines (ToolkitId excluded).
.TP
.B Use <url>
.br
Replace the current URL with <url> and terminate toolkit processing.
.TP
.B UseFastCGI <fcgi_id>
.br
Use FastCGI server with id <fcgi_id> and terminate toolkit processing.

.TP
The original URL is stored in the environment variable REQUEST_URI. Before using URL toolkit rules, use the tool 'wigwam' to verify the result of your rules (see wigwam(1) for more information).

.TP
.B Example:
VirtualHost {
.br
	...
.br
	UseToolkit = clean_url
.br
}
.br

.br
	RequestURI exists Return
.br
	Match ^/.*\\?(.*) Rewrite /index.php?$1
.br
	Match ^/.* Rewrite /index.php
.br
}

.\" ==========[ XSLT ]=========================================================
.SH XSLT
If a XML file is requested, Hiawatha can do a XSL transformation when a XSLT sheet is present. For the requested XML file (<name>.xml), '<name>.xslt', 'index.xslt' in the current directory or 'index.xslt' in the WebsiteRoot needs to be present. Otherwise, the XML file itself will be uploaded. The environment variables which are available during CGI execution are available as XSLT parameters. URL variables start with 'GET_', POST variables start with 'POST_' and cookies start with 'COOKIE_'.

.\" ==========[ CGI cache ]====================================================
.SH CGI OUTPUT CACHE
Hiawatha can cache the output of CGI applications. When and for how long is determined by the application itself. It can use the following CGI headers to control the caching of its output. This feature requires that Hiawatha was not compiled with -DENABLE_CACHE=off.
.TP
.B X-Hiawatha-Cache: <seconds>
.br
The output can be cached for <seconds> seconds. The minimum value is 2, the maximum value is 3600 (one hour).
.br
Example: X-Hiawatha-Cache: 600
.TP
.B X-Hiawatha-Cache-Remove: <url>
.br
The output of <url> should be removed from the cache. Use this when you update a cached page in your CMS. Use 'all' as the URL to clear the cache for the current website.
.br
Example: X-Hiawatha-Cache-Remove: /about

.\" ===========================================================================
.SH USER SETTINGS PER DIRECTORY
A user can override the settings listed below for a certain directory. This can be done by placing one or more of those settings in a .hiawatha file in that directory. Hiawatha will not look for a .hiawatha file in the root directory of the disk.
