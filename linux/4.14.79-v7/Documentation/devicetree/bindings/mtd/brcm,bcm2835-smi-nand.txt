* BCM2835 SMI NAND flash

This driver is a shim between the BCM2835 SMI driver (SMI is a peripheral for
talking to parallel register interfaces) and Linux's MTD layer.

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,bcm2835-smi-nand"
- status: "okay"

Optional properties:
- partition@n, where n is an integer from a consecutive sequence starting at 0
	- Difficult to store partition table on NAND device - normally put it
	in the source code, kernel bootparams, or device tree (the best way!)
	- Sub-properties:
		- label: the partition name, as shown by mtdinfo /dev/mtd*
		- reg: the size and offset of this partition.
		- (optional) read-only: an empty property flagging as read only

Example:

nand: flash@0 {
	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-smi-nand";
	status = "okay";

	partition@0 {
		label = "stage2";
		// 128k
		reg = <0 0x20000>;
		read-only;
	};
	partition@1 {
		label = "firmware";
		// 16M
		reg = <0x20000 0x1000000>;
		read-only;
	};
	partition@2 {
		label = "root";
		// 2G
		reg = <0x1020000 0x80000000>;
	};
};
