=====================

This driver enables the use of the Raspberry Pi PoE HAT fan.

Author: Serge Schneider <serge@raspberrypi.org>

Description
-----------

The driver implements a simple interface for driving the Raspberry Pi PoE
(Power over Ethernet) HAT fan. The driver passes commands to the Raspberry Pi
firmware through the mailbox property interface. The firmware then forwards
the commands to the board over I2C on the ID_EEPROM pins. The driver exposes
the fan to the user space through the hwmon sysfs interface.
