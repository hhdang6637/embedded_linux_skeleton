* Mmcoops oops/panic logger

Mmcoops is an oops/panic logger that write its logs to MMC before the system crashes.
Introduction and concept are similar to other oops logger.
(Refer to Documention/ramoops.txt)
- Disadvantage: if MMC is occurred an oops/panic, this logger can't work.

After reboot, you can get the last log with below command.
#dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/tmp/dump.log skip=64 count=16
#vi dump.log

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be "mmcoops"
* start-offset: block-offset for start.
* size: the number of block to write oopses and panics.

Example:
	mmcoops {
		compatible = "mmcoops";
		start-offset = <64>;	/* 64 * 512B = 32KiB offset */
		size = <16>;		/* 16 * 512B = 8KiB */
	};
